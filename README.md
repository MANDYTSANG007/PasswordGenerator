# Password Generator

This Password Generator project is modified using JavaScript. It allows employees to generate a random password based on five criteria: password length, lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numeric numbers, and special characters. 


## Getting Started

When it runs on a browser, a prompt will be displayed asking the user to make a choice of the password length. The user must choose the length between 8 and 128. If they choose less than 8 or greater than 128, an alert will be displayed. Once they select the length, the program will confirm whether the users like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric number, or special characters in their password. 

Before generating a password, this program will check if at least one character was selected. If not, an alert will be displayed to remind users that they must choose at least one character. A random password will be generated after all criteria are met.
